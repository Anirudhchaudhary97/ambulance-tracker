<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This web app assists hospitals by bridging the communication gap between Ambulance driver and hospital management especially during emergency cases. This web app successfully tracks and alerts hospital management by which delay in treatment of patients can be reduced. This could potentially save lives.

This will be very useful at times of emergency cases which assists in timely treatment of patients. This works by tracking ambulance location(coordinates) in real-time.
